Linear: 11230.3030x+-9766.6667	Income at year 15: $158687.88
This answer makes sense because it is greater than its previous points, but might be a little high as estimations go.

Quadratic: 2876.3031x^2+-51200.9743x+222867.6876	Income at year 15: $102021.28
This answert makes sense because it is greater than previous estimations, and is more realistic than the linear model.
